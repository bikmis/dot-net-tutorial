C#

1. Difference between value types and reference types
Value type is created directly in memory. Each instance keeps a copy of data.
int a = 5;
int b = a; (value 5 is passed)

Reference type shares a single piece of data. It points to a memory address on stack
which points to a value on heap.
var a = new student();
var b = a; (var a and var b both point to the same reference that points to the same object) 

2. Difference between interface and abstract class

3. Is multiple inheritance allowed in C#?
No

4. Where is virtual used?

5. What is generic?

6. What is a sealed class?

7. What is boxing and unboxing?
