1. What is ng-content, ng-template

2. Angular CLI

3. Unit testing with Karma / Jasmine ng-test and end-to-end test with protractor

4. Lifecycle hooks - ngOnChanges, ngOnInit, ngDoCheck, ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterContentChecked, ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterViewChecked, ngOnDestroy

5. We can render angular application on the server side.

6. Dependency injection- We can make an injectable service and provide it in root. Then we can call it from any of the components.

7. AOT (ahead of time) compilation: The application compiles during the build time for fast rendering.

8. JIT (just in time) compilation: The compiles inside the browser during runtime.

9. Interpolation is done using {{}} to bind data one-way from the component to the view.

10. Authentication and Authorization

11. ng generate component name, ng generate directive name, ng g enum name, ng g guard name, ng g interceptor name, ng g interface name

12. Difference between Observable and Promise: Observables are lazy and nothing happens until subscribed, but once a promise is built, it is executed. Promises 
    handle a single event whereas observalble is a stream of data/event

13. Directive: (a) attribute (ngClass, ngStyle) (b) structural (*ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch) (c) custom

14. Building blocks of Angular: component, data binding, dependency injection, directive, metadata, module, routing, service, template

15. Data binding: event binding, property binding, two-way binding

16. RxJs (Reactive programming)

17. TypeScript

18. npm install

19. ng new projectName, ng build, ng serve,
